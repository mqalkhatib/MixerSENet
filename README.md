# Requirements:
Python 3.9.18, Tensorflow (and Keras) 2.10.0.

# Datasets:
The evaluation is performed on two widely used hyperspectral datasets: Houston13 and QUH-Qingyun. link to the datasets along their class maps is available at:
https://mega.nz/folder/zoJDhJKI#bNj3Xr0iLenBN12QdmGccw

# Results:
To quantitatively measure the proposed MixerSENet model, three evaluation metrics are employed to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm, Overall Accuracy (OA), Average Accuracy (AA) and Cohen's Kappa (k). Also, Each class accuracy has been reported.
